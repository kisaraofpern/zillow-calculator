# Getting Started
This is a quick little side project that takes advantage of the Zillow API.

You'll need to run the following commands to get started!

`npm install`
`bundle install`

Then in order to get the application up and running you have to open up two
tabs and run `ruby server.rb` in one and `npm start` in the other!

You can add your React components within the `react` folder, where you will see
there is already a `main.js` setup for you. This `main.js` replaces the `<div>`
with an id of `app` in the `index.html` file of the application with your React
app.
